# twix - Twitter Pix

This app provides a scripted input for [Splunk](http://www.splunk.com/) that
automatically extracts tweets from [Twitter](https://twitter.com/)'s [1% sample
stream](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1/get/statuses/sample).

A number of dashboards and searches are also included to demonstrate how Splunk
can be used to visualize Twitter activity.

## Installation

# Install from Splunk Base

* In the Splunk web interface, from the App menu, select the Twitter app. And
  press "Continue to app setup page".

* Enter your Twitter credentials and click "Save". (If you don't already have a
  Twitter account, you can sign up for one at
  [https://twitter.com/](https://twitter.com/).)

* Wait 15 seconds or so for some tweets to be extracted.

* Run the search `index=twitter` in Splunk to see the events. If you don't see
  any events, open `$SPLUNK_HOME/var/log/splunk/splunkd.log` and look for errors
  issued by ExecProcessor related to the
  `$SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/twitter/bin/twitter_stream.py` script.
